# Teaching Formula

## Plan:

1. The hardest question: What new things do I want to teach?
2. How can those things be demonstrated in a working example?
3. Step-by-step, how would I build it?
4. Where can students go to learn more?


## Prepare:

1. Build the example:
  + One concept per commit.
  + Concept as commit summary.
  + Explanations and links to additional resources as commit body.
  + Push to Github.
2. Create lesson outline:
  1. List what we will be learning.
  2. Link to the working example.
  3. Tutorial to build it step-by-step, with explanations and resources on each step.
  4. Summary of what we've learned and resources.


## Execute:

1. Explain what we will be learning.
2. Show the working example.
3. Incrementally build, explain, answer questions, point to additional resources.
4. Summarize what we learned.
