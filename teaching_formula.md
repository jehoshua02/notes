# Teaching Formula

## Plan

1. The hardest question: What new things do I want to teach?
2. How can those things be demonstrated in a working example?
3. Step-by-step, how would I build it?
4. Where can students go to learn more?


## Prepare

1. Build the example:
  + One concept per commit.
  + Concept as commit summary.
  + Explanations and links to additional resources as commit body.
  + Push to Github.
2. Create lesson outline:
  1. Intro: What we will be learning.
  2. What we will be building.
  3. Step-by-step Tutorial. Each step could be generated from commits:
    1. Commit Summary as step title.
    2. Git diff for code changes.
    3. Commit body as step explanation and links to additional resources.
  4. Summary of what we've learned and complete list of resources.


## Execute

1. Explain what we will be learning.
2. Show the working example.
3. Incrementally build, explain, answer questions, point to additional resources.
4. Summarize what we learned.
